# javascript and classes
### Yes, JavaScript does have classes. However, it's important to understand that JavaScript's class syntax is somewhat different from other programming languages like Java or C++. JavaScript's classes are essentially syntactic sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance model.

### Classes in JavaScript were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015. They provide a more familiar syntax for defining objects and dealing with inheritance. Here's an example of how classes are defined in JavaScript:
